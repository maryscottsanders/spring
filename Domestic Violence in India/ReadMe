Domestic Violence in India: Clustering Victims of DV for Outreach
This analysis uses K Means clustering on USAID's DHS India 2015-2016 survey data to group women in India (in unions) according to their experience with domestic violence. 
Three primary groups were found: those that report dv, those that are afraid of their partners but don't report dv, and those that are neither afraid nor report dv.
Suggestions are made on how to tailor social campaigns toward the partners of these women, and these women, in an order to more effectively target dv in India.
